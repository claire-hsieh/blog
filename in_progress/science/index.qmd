I've had this thought floating around my head for a while now but I noticed that many of the non-fiction books I've read (they're usually physics / bio related) like to go through the history of that field or the discoveries that led up to some topic that the author wants to dig into. Most recently, I read [*The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/8701960) by James Gleick and this may not be the greatest example since it's a little more abstract than the hard sciences, but in the book, Gleick talks about communication and information. He starts out with African drums and how they can be used to communicate over incredibly large distances (but have only two symbols: high and low beats), moves on to telegraphs, then phones and along the way, he's talking about Shannon and his information theory (creating a way of measuring the amount of information in a message or "bits"), Turing and his computer, Kolomogrov and complexity (how complex an object is can be measured by how long the shortest algorithm needed to generate is (ie 11111 is less complex than 133245), and so on. (It took me a year to read this book because I left it at home \~300 miles away, so I don't remember details)

But I was thinking, science is often taught in the order that it was discovered. While I'd love to put a genetics example, I think physics just makes more sense here. Normally (not at UC Davis where they love to put an incredibly un-intuitive spin on the curriculum) you'd start the series with gravity and forces (Newton, Hookes law, ) (things you've learned informally as a toddler (hopefully)), move on to atoms and particles (double slit experiment, Bohr's model, Pauli, Rutherford, Leonard Jones), then electromagnetism and quantum (Faraday, Tesla, Edison). If you are even somewhat familiar with physics some of the names should be familiar. But what I'm trying to say is, the order in which these subjects lines up with roughly with the order that these discoveries happened. And based on how much the physics curriculum is hated at Davis, I feel like order of discovery is maybe the best order for learning.

When I took history in HS, I remember it blew my mind to think that the Byzantine Empire existed during the time of the Inca Empire and that this took place thousands of years after the Egyptians. Because in history, they like to teach things by region (or at least they did in my classes) and I feel like this makes sense, there are so many things going on all the time, there's simply no easy way to keep track of it all, all at once. Much simpler to simply break the world into bite size pieces and take it in one at a time.

And then there's CS. I think this differs from the other topics (not just STEM) in that it is wholly man made (only other exception is philosophy?) and for the most apart, its development is not influenced by the world around it. By that I simply mean, CS principles are not explaining real world phenomena; algorithms developed are used to solve problems or just ingenious little puzzles we set for ourselves (we are clever little monkeys after all). Traversing a tree (DFS or BFS) or finding the shortest path between two vertices (Dijkstra's algorithm) doesn't have any basis in the real world, there is no fundamental truth of the world that these algorithms reveal. (I watched a video on Dijkstra's and it reminds me of slime molds for some reason so I might be wrong on that) But because CS feels so removed from reality, I think the order for which CS is taught is even more tightly bound to the order in which concepts were invented. There was nothing for the innovators in the field to go on but methods and ideas that others had invented. So I feel like innovation in CS follows a very logical progression, just people making the next logical jump using what they had. Or is it logical?

I "read" the *Attention is all you need* paper the other day (I say "read" because I understood individual words but not sentences (yes I can speak English, but at elementary levels apparently)) and I just thought to myself, "This is so complicated. How in the world did someone (or even a group of someones) come up with something as clever as this?" (I have some thoughts on individual vs group intelligence that I might expand on in another post) Is self-attention really the next logical progression after RNNs (some sort of neural network that I known next to nothing about but was the most prominent deep learning at the time. I think?) With algorithms like Dijkstra's, you simply start from one node in a vertex, check its un-visited neighboring nodes, and check the distances from all those nodes to their neighboring nodes to find the shortest path. (makes more sense if you see it in action, [link here](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_graphs_dijkstra.php#:~:text=Dijkstra's%20algorithm%20finds%20the%20shortest,all%20the%20unvisited%20neighboring%20vertices.)), but this is fairly intuitive and I feel like the most obvious answer to the shortest path problem. But neural networks and transformers? When I first saw a neural network, I thought it was a spin-off of Markov Models, but I don't think the two are ever really taught together (not that I've ever taken a machine learning class so what do I know). I feel like with science now, we've moved on from the "easy" stuff (not that it was ever easy, gosh I feel like Dennett with his arm chair philosophy and [easy and hard problems of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#:~:text=To%20address%20the%20question%20of,the%20easy%20problems%20of%20consciousness.)) but rather the logical, "next step" discoveries in science and we've moved past the questions that have plagued us for centuries (what are the fundamental building blocks of life (the cell / DNA) or nature (atoms)? How do they function) and now in addition to discovery, we have to start coming up with questions that we want answered OR these questions just pop up along the way. But in any case, these are questions that may never have been asked before in history (or maybe they have and I'm just yapping which is most likely the case)

(I know I added the Lorenz attractor which has nothing at all to do with anything I talked about, but Gleick also wrote this book, [Chaos: Making a New Science](https://www.google.com/search?q=chaos+gleick&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS993US993&oq=chaos+glei&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyBwgBEC4YgAQyBggCEEUYOTIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMggIBxAAGBYYHjIICAgQABgWGB4yCAgJEAAYFhgeqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)), which was the first book of his that I read. And I LOVED it. Also it's just a very pleasant picture to look at. Better than any other visualization that could come out of information theory imo)
