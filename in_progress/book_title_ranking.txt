# Book Title Rankings

I'll rate a couple book titles that I like (does not mean I like the book, but I can appreciate a well made title regardless). Rating will be based on: 

- "punchiness"
- how related it is to the book (plot, setting, etc.)
- other: some other factors that I don't know how to verbalize

1. Atlas Shrugged
	- about how society basically rests on the work of a few talented individuals (i don't agree) and how if these few choose not to participate in anymore, society crumbles
	- very on point plot-wise, good imagery, very punchy

2. 

Love in the Time of Cholera
