British slang for acts of affection are all so horribly unromantic ("shagging", "snogging", etc.) Is it just me, being a prudish American, who thinks that those are v private acts for which we should use more clinical / serious terms for?

Whenever I see artwork (usually on Pinterest) of some scene (I like the pop-art, cyber punk aesthetics), I'm always blown away at the level of detail that can be found in these (I assume are un-commissioned pieces). Had the thought that there really isn't as much detail to be found in a clean, minimalist room compared to a cluttered, messy one (just think dystopian, cyberbunk scenes). And if we were to (reverse?) render reality into an image, the everyday mess would be a work of art, and those well organized spaces (minimalistic mansions) would seem uninteresting in comparison. Bit strange to think that we work so hard to fight entropy in real life, but entropy is what brings a piece of work to life.
