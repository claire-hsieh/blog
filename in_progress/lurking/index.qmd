As an avid reader of Wired (greatest magazine ever created as far as I'm concerned), I think about the internet *a lot*. I'm a bit sad to report it's where I spend a good portion of my day, either studying or consuming social media or running digital errands, checking email and the like, performing all the little tasks that seem to keep my life running.  But the disappointing bit is that with either, I am a consumer of media. I am not producing anything and any gains I've made are solely for my own benefit. 

Recently, I've had the pleasure of reading Virginia Heffernan's <3 book, *Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art*. [...]
 I've always had a voracious appetite for reading, whether that's through a screen or on paper, but with the internet, oh boy, it's a never ending buffet of videos and audio and good old-fashioned text. 

Yet, most people's presence isn't visible on the internet in any capacity as anything but a statistic on site analytics. The [90-10-1 Rule](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-you-know-whos-lurking-90-social-media-users-lurkers-joey-little/) states that 90% of people are lurkers, 10% comment, like, post, etc. , and only 1% consistently produce original content. But is this truly such a bad thing? I think not. Unlike books, which I think could be considered an archaic version of the internet (you read things other people have written), you have the *ability* to comment on the web. I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I read a bit of Wattpad growing up. And one thing I did notice was the sense of community and support for the author there was in the comments section. Reading is often seen as a solitary activity, only in select situations (book clubs / bed time stories) are they communal, but the internet has made it so that *all* reading is a group activity, if that's what you want. Everyone's free to ignore the comments section, but I've noticed that in cases where you're truly intrigued, people often gravitate towards the comments section. There you can speak about your own ideas or listen to others give their perspective. But the point is, with the internet, gives you the option to think more deeply, converse, pick apart, and even to contact the creators. With that being said, I don't think lurking is necessarily a problem, it is the default for reading, and only with the advent of the internet does lurking become a choice, which I don't think we should shame people for. 

As a lifelong lurker, I feel like I've become a bit too shy to engage in Reddit discourse or god forbid the Youtube comments warzone. And I suppose the reason I made this blog was to create a space on the internet where I have total control. So much of our lives is spent in this virtual space, yet never had I been anything but a casual browser or contributing on another's forum. Websites and apps are, in my mind, not connected in a typical spatial manner. 

On my own device, I have files organized under folders and to find anything, I have to dig in a top down approach. But on the internet, sites are linked tangentially, by topic and not necessarily logical connections (i.e. cooking being labelled along with woodwork due to the need for recipes / manuals for both). What this mean, in my opinion, is that there are no landmarks to guide a user from one site to another. Recalling where you've been after spending a few hours browsing Youtube is incredibly difficult (for me anyway), especially if it's in the Shorts format. The volume of information I consume is incredible and simply overwhelming. For whatever reason, information found on social media often doesn't give the same sense of satisfaction as reading or even watching tv or playing video games. There is neither a narrative (like books / movies) nor user involvement (video games). Because of the lack of either background knowledge or knowledge of game dynamics, they are easy to jump into, yet more than anything else, I feel guilt and an uneasy sense that I am simply wasting time when watching shorts / scrolling through Instagram. My refusal to use TikTok is mainly because of the fact that an entire platform made of short-form videos (arguably the most addictive type of content sans p***) is horrifying to me. It is a black hole that I don't think I have the willpower to climb out of if I ever get started. 

I wouldn't go so far as to say that I disdain TikTok creators, some videos that I have seen could most definitely classify as art but my impression of the vast majority of TikTok videos is that they're shallow and base, either straight up manipulative (I'm thinking of those "Do you have ADHD?" videos) or appeal to the desperate, lonely aspects of human nature (random videos of human interactions). But that's my opinion and I know I am being unnecessarily harsh, maybe because I can't accept the fact that I am watching TikTok videos too, albeit through different platforms.
