But if you don’t finish the book, are you qualified to review it? My opinion is yes, if you’ve finished a chapter or two. Where this threshold is, could be an interesting idea to quantify.\nWhen reviewing a book, there are certain qualities to consider: writing, plot, characters, world-building, and some ineffable quality that ties it all together, which I’m just going to call pizzazz. Writing quality could most definitely be judged by the first few pages. The rest is a harder to say. Characters, I believe can\nWhat about books that redeem themselves towards the end? This is a bit like a failing student redeeming their grade through the final exam. Would it be unfair to the writer if you don’t finish the book and judge them solely through the first few chapters?\non one hand, it’s a bit like judging someone after knowing them for five min."

    "text": "As an avid reader of Wired (greatest magazine ever created as far as I’m concerned, though their invention of the banner ad mars their reputation), I think about the internet a lot. I’m a bit dismayed to report it’s where I spend a good portion of my day, either studying, consuming social media, or running digital errands, checking email and the like, performing all the little tasks that have become necessary to keep my life running. But the disappointing bit is that, I am a consumer of media. I am not producing anything and any gains I’ve made are solely for my own benefit.\nRecently, I’ve had the pleasure of reading Virginia Heffernan’s &lt;3 book, Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art. Started it months ago, and finally finished today. I’ve always had a voracious appetite for reading, whether that’s through a screen or on paper, but with the internet, oh boy, it’s a never ending buffet of videos and audio and good old-fashioned text.\nYet, most people’s presence isn’t visible on the internet in any capacity as anything but a statistic on site analytics. The 90-10-1 Rule states that 90% of people are lurkers, 10% comment, like, post, etc. , and only 1% consistently produce original content. But is this truly such a bad thing? I think not. Unlike books, which I think could be considered an archaic version of the internet (you read things other people have written), you have the ability to comment on the web. I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit that I read a bit of Wattpad growing up. And one thing I did notice was the sense of community and support for the author there was in the comments section. Reading is often seen as a solitary activity, only in select situations (book clubs / bed time stories) are they communal, but the internet has made it so that all reading is a group activity, if that’s what you want. Everyone’s free to ignore the comments section, but I’ve noticed that in cases where you’re truly intrigued, people often gravitate towards the comments section. There you can speak about your own ideas or listen to others give their perspective. But the point is, with the internet, gives you the option to think more deeply, converse, pick apart, and even to contact the creators. With that being said, I don’t think lurking is necessarily a problem, it is the default for reading, and only with the advent of the internet does lurking become a choice, which I don’t think we should shame people for.\nAs a lifelong lurker, I feel like I’ve become a bit too shy to engage in Reddit discourse or god forbid the Youtube comments warzone. And I suppose the reason I made this blog was to create a space on the internet where I have total control. So much of our lives is spent in this virtual space, yet never had I been anything but a casual browser or contributing on another’s forum. Websites and apps are, in my mind, not connected in a typical spatial manner.\nOn my own device, I have files organized under folders and to find anything, I have to dig in a top down approach. But on the internet, sites are linked tangentially, by topic and not necessarily logical connections (i.e. cooking being labelled along with woodwork due to the need for recipes / manuals for both). What this mean, in my opinion, is that there are no landmarks to guide a user from one site to another. Recalling where you’ve been after spending a few hours browsing Youtube is incredibly difficult (for me anyway), especially if it’s in the Shorts format. The volume of information I consume is incredible and simply overwhelming. For whatever reason, information found on social media often doesn’t give the same sense of satisfaction as reading or even watching tv or playing video games. There is neither a narrative (like books / movies) nor user involvement (video games). Because of the lack of either background knowledge or knowledge of game dynamics, they are easy to jump into, yet more than anything else, I feel guilt and an uneasy sense that I am simply wasting time when watching shorts / scrolling through Instagram. My refusal to use TikTok is mainly because of the fact that an entire platform made of short-form videos (arguably the most addictive type of content sans p***) is horrifying to me. It is a black hole that I don’t think I have the willpower to climb out of if I ever get started.\nI wouldn’t go so far as to say that I disdain TikTok creators, some videos that I have seen could most definitely classify as art but my impression of the vast majority of TikTok videos is that they’re shallow and base, either straight up manipulative (I’m thinking of those “Do you have ADHD?” videos) or appeal to the desperate, lonely aspects of human nature (random videos of human interactions). But that’s my opinion and I know I am being unnecessarily harsh, maybe because I can’t accept the fact that I am watching TikTok videos too, albeit through different platforms."

Had the thought that there really isn’t as much detail to be found in a clean, minimalist room compared to a cluttered, messy one (just think dystopian, cyberbunk scenes). And if we were to (reverse?) render reality into an image, the everyday mess would be a work of art, and those well organized spaces (minimalistic mansions) would seem uninteresting in comparison. Bit strange to think that we work so hard to fight entropy in real life, but entropy is what brings a piece of work to life."

    "text": "I’ve had this thought floating around my head for a while now but I noticed that many of the non-fiction books I’ve read (they’re usually physics / bio related) like to go through the history of that field or the discoveries that led up to some topic that the author wants to dig into. Most recently, I read The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood by James Gleick and this may not be the greatest example since it’s a little more abstract than the hard sciences, but in the book, Gleick talks about communication and information. He starts out with African drums and how they can be used to communicate over incredibly large distances (but have only two symbols: high and low beats), moves on to telegraphs, then phones and along the way, he’s talking about Shannon and his information theory (creating a way of measuring the amount of information in a message or “bits”), Turing and his computer, Kolomogrov and complexity (how complex an object is can be measured by how long the shortest algorithm needed to generate is (ie 11111 is less complex than 133245), and so on. (It took me a year to read this book because I left it at home ~300 miles away, so I don’t remember details)\nBut I was thinking, science is often taught in the order that it was discovered. While I’d love to put a genetics example, I think physics just makes more sense here. Normally (not at UC Davis where they love to put an incredibly un-intuitive spin on the curriculum) you’d start the series with gravity and forces (Newton, Hookes law, ) (things you’ve learned informally as a toddler (hopefully)), move on to atoms and particles (double slit experiment, Bohr’s model, Pauli, Rutherford, Leonard Jones), then electromagnetism and quantum (Faraday, Tesla, Edison). If you are even somewhat familiar with physics some of the names should be familiar. But what I’m trying to say is, the order in which these subjects lines up with roughly with the order that these discoveries happened. And based on how much the physics curriculum is hated at Davis, I feel like order of discovery is maybe the best order for learning.\nWhen I took history in HS, I remember it blew my mind to think that the Byzantine Empire existed during the time of the Inca Empire and that this took place thousands of years after the Egyptians. Because in history, they like to teach things by region (or at least they did in my classes) and I feel like this makes sense, there are so many things going on all the time, there’s simply no easy way to keep track of it all, all at once. Much simpler to simply break the world into bite size pieces and take it in one at a time.\nAnd then there’s CS. I think this differs from the other topics (not just STEM) in that it is wholly man made (only other exception is philosophy?) and for the most apart, its development is not influenced by the world around it. By that I simply mean, CS principles are not explaining real world phenomena; algorithms developed are used to solve problems or just ingenious little puzzles we set for ourselves (we are clever little monkeys after all). Traversing a tree (DFS or BFS) or finding the shortest path between two vertices (Dijkstra’s algorithm) doesn’t have any basis in the real world, there is no fundamental truth of the world that these algorithms reveal. (I watched a video on Dijkstra’s and it reminds me of slime molds for some reason so I might be wrong on that) But because CS feels so removed from reality, I think the order for which CS is taught is even more tightly bound to the order in which concepts were invented. There was nothing for the innovators in the field to go on but methods and ideas that others had invented. So I feel like innovation in CS follows a very logical progression, just people making the next logical jump using what they had. Or is it logical?\nI “read” the Attention is all you need paper the other day (I say “read” because I understood individual words but not sentences (yes I can speak English, but at elementary levels apparently)) and I just thought to myself, “This is so complicated. How in the world did someone (or even a group of someones) come up with something as clever as this?” (I have some thoughts on individual vs group intelligence that I might expand on in another post) Is self-attention really the next logical progression after RNNs (some sort of neural network that I known next to nothing about but was the most prominent deep learning at the time. I think?) With algorithms like Dijkstra’s, you simply start from one node in a vertex, check its un-visited neighboring nodes, and check the distances from all those nodes to their neighboring nodes to find the shortest path. (makes more sense if you see it in action, link here), but this is fairly intuitive and I feel like the most obvious answer to the shortest path problem. But neural networks and transformers? When I first saw a neural network, I thought it was a spin-off of Markov Models, but I don’t think the two are ever really taught together (not that I’ve ever taken a machine learning class so what do I know). I feel like with science now, we’ve moved on from the “easy” stuff (not that it was ever easy, gosh I feel like Dennett with his arm chair philosophy and easy and hard problems of consciousness) but rather the logical, “next step” discoveries in science and we’ve moved past the questions that have plagued us for centuries (what are the fundamental building blocks of life (the cell / DNA) or nature (atoms)? How do they function) and now in addition to discovery, we have to start coming up with questions that we want answered OR these questions just pop up along the way. But in any case, these are questions that may never have been asked before in history (or maybe they have and I’m just yapping which is most likely the case)\n(I know I added the Lorenz attractor which has nothing at all to do with anything I talked about, but Gleick also wrote this book, Chaos: Making a New Science), which was the first book of his that I read. And I LOVED it. Also it’s just a very pleasant picture to look at. Better than any other visualization that could come out of information theory imo)"

Every sentence is beautifully written, there’s not a word out of place and the transition from words to visuals in your mind is absolutely seamless. I have a theory that all the great authors secretly want to be poets. Because poets are obsessed with the perfect words, their placement, prose, but writers! writers have to always have the narrative on their mind. They can meander (within reason) but not with the same degree of freedom that poets have. I think Tartt would be a wonderful poet, but everyday I’m grateful that she’s not, because I love this book beyond reason.\nHalf the sentences will span a quarter of the page, yet I hardly notice it. It’s not a burden to be dragged through the scene, it’s a blessing. And it’s all in this rich, elegant voice that I couldn’t quite place until I saw an interview she did, years ago, and she spoke with this beautiful, slow, southern accent and it all clicked. Love this book. Highly recommend.\n\n\n- The Secret History by Donna Tartt\n\nI read The Goldfinch first and I read this solely because it was written by Tartt. Beautifully written. I think, more than anything, Tartt’s a master of directing moods, because there’s a bit where (spoiler) Richard almost freezes to death and there’s such a dreary air to the scene that I’ll never forget.\n\n\n- If We Were Villains by M.L. Rio\n\nThis book made me like Shakespeare.\n\n\n- Normal People by Sally Rooney\n\nA reminder that communication mishaps are just part of life and sometimes you’ll feel lonely and oh so misunderstood."

But gods, there’s so much more to the genre: epic fantasy, grimdark, urban, steampunk, and on and on. I could yammer on about this all day, but I’ll cut to the chase and just talk about the book recs.\n\n- The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss\n\nThis book is the literal personification of “reckless hero for whom everything always works out, usually through acts of incredible wit and bravery and a dash of good luck” but in a way that’s just shy of deus ex machina. I love it. It’s like a grown up version of all the children’s books I used to read (Fablehaven, Five Kingdoms, 31 Clues, Harry Potter, and the like)\n\n\n- A Deadly Education by Naomi Novik\n\nI’ve had friends say that this book focuses too much on world building, but I don’t read fantasy because I think real life is cool and wacky enough; I want to see things that are on the border of our imagination (guess that’s why science is appealing to me, pushing the limits of knowledge / abilities and whatnot). World building is what A Deadly Education has in spades, much like Harry Potter I might add, and I love it! Readers of Lord of the Ring may also be happy to hear that the main character is named Galadriel.\n\n\n- Vita Nostra by Maryna and Serhiy Dyachenko\n\nI read this in the year where I had to take Ochem and it was a dark time for me, especially since I had just moved to college (post-pandemic 2021 Davis, CA) and was feeling awful, isolated and overworked yet somehow completely apathetic to school. But this book came at the right moment. I guess it could be compared to Harry Potter (guess I have a thing for HP-esque books) in that it’s set in a magic school somewhere in Europe (to me, an American / Californian, snowy Russian winters and bleak, rainy Britain is equally miserable to me). But that’s where the similarities end since Vita Nostra takes a dark, psychologically twisted turn. Without giving away too many spoilers, I’ll just say that when I’m in a not so happy state, I love to read about people who have it much worse than me and Vita Nostra really hit the spot on that one."

Movies are great but I don’t think they’ll ever be able to rival the action in this book. Nothing is as torturous as your own mind, you can’t move past a difficult scene by just closing your eyes. To move on, you have to keep reading. And this is a book with ACTION and DRAMA, where all your favorite characters will inevitably be punished by the whims of bad luck and sadistic antagonists only Pierce Brown is able to dream up."

I am sad to report, I really don’t think anything has changed. Corn still has a choke hold on the American diet and we’re still eating ultra-processed foods. Plant based diets have made a strong rally, but they’re still grown in mono-culture type farms, with petrol made pesticides in distant countries where it’ll take a busload of oil to get produce to market.

Autobiography?\n\n- Wind, Sand, and Stars by Antoine St. Exupery\n\nYou would think a book written by a French pilot with a plane on the cover would primarily be about aircraft and flight and you wouldn’t be wrong but it’s more than that. For St. Exupery, the plane is a tool, somehow removing him from the rest of humanity but at the same time bringing him closer to other people and to nature. Wherever he goes, his focus always swings back to the people and unbridled wilderness of mother nature. He steps closer to death and danger than just about anyone has in this day and age. Since I’ve grown up safely cloistered in the suburbs of California where it’s relatively temperate year round, the thought of facing bitter, hypothermia inducing cold and cyclone-level winds with only the thin walls of a plane between him and the elements makes me re-evaluate my entire view on civilization and how far we’ve come.\nThis is a beautiful book and every page makes you want to sink into his story and just marvel at the world. Written in the 30s, the world as more disconnected then but he voices the same fears that people have now of machines and their displacement of people. But then, and even more so now, technology brings people together in ways that we couldn’t imagine a few hundred years ago. Telegrams allowing us to communicate across oceans and smartphones giving us access to friends and family at any hour of the day. The most poignant part of this book was the simple realization that as incredible as modern innovations can be, the only thing that really matters is other people and the relationships we form along the way, which sounds cheesy but I think it’s very true and I would hate to forget that.\n\n\n- Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer\n\nI think about this book every so often when life feels like it’s getting to be a bit much and I feel the overwhelming urge to just escape into the California wilderness, surviving on acorns and wild onions."

    "text": "Term Paper for my Journalism class\n\nThose born after 1998 have never known a world without Google, much less the Internet. People no longer comb through book upon book for relevant information, instead a few well-placed keywords in a search engine will yield the same result. This younger generation has had to learn not just how to read, but also how not to read, how not to be overwhelmed by the endless amount of content especially since the internet is now accessible through devices to be carried wherever they go.\n“If it’s ever fair to say that anything has ‘changed everything,’ it’s fair to say so about the Internet,” said Virginia Heffernan in her book, “Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art”.\nThe internet has been one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 20th century, greatly simplifying the process of finding information and enabling users to communicate with people across the globe. It has oh so subtly integrated itself into everyday life, so much so, that some may even consider it a basic human right. Much of the internet’s allure, especially for younger users, can be attributed to social media and the endless stream of content that apps provide, often via a JavaScript plug-in known as the infinite scroll.\nInfinite scroll allows websites to load more pages as users scroll down and is particularly useful for apps providing constant content of similar relevance to the user. The effort required to find more content effectively becomes negligible and (besides the equally endless ads) interruptions such as loading pages are minimized. The infinite scroll combined with algorithms utilized by social media sites such as Tik Tok or YouTube provide an experience as seamless as possible for the user, constantly offering up content similar to what the user has seen in the past.\nHistorically, the internet was “hierarchically organized  [with] stuff inside of folders inside of folders”, said Dr. Ian Korf, a professor at UC Davis and a user of the early internet, as opposed to the modern-day internet, which”relates a whole bunch of stuff to other stuff. It’s not organized in a way that’s completely hierarchical. It’s going across hierarchies.”\nThis restructuring is what allows social media algorithms to find maximally appealing content for users, content similar enough to what they’ve seen in the past to feel relevant, yet novel enough to interest them. According to one Harvard study, participants are 21% more likely to watch related videos than they are to watch unrelated videos and the more one watches, the more likely they are to continue watching. Companies leverage this knowledge of human behavior and psychology to design algorithms that feed users content optimized for engagement and when combined with infinite scroll, which delivers content to users with minimal effort, effectively traps users in an endless loop of content and ads.\nAccording to Anna Lembke, author of “Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence”, the risk factors for addiction are easy access and speedy reward, both of which are characteristic of social media platforms. Beyond design, content on these platforms appeals to the innate human need to connect and seek out novelty. Working together has been a key to our species’ survival and ability to flourish. When we make human connections, whether that’s through watching videos or seeing posts, the brain releases dopamine, incentivizing us to watch another video or to scroll onward. And the simple ease with which users can continue watching videos, each one a small dopamine hit, makes it incredibly difficult to stop.\nAccording to Gallup, teens spend an average of 4.8 hours on social media a day and this excessive screen time can be especially damaging for youth, whose brains are still developing. According to one study, excessive screen time has been found to disrupt sleeping habits, causing both shorter sleep durations and poorer sleep quality. The use of social media has also been shown to be associated with an increased risk of self-harm and depression and lower levels of self-esteem in females.\n“The overuse of social media can actually rewire a young child or teen’s brain to constantly seek out immediate gratification, leading to obsessive, compulsive and addictive behaviors,” said Dr. Nancy DeAngelis, Director of Behavioral Health at Jefferson Health, “This is what can make mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, ADHD and body dysmorphia worse.”\nThe serious health consequences of social media addiction pose an urgent public health concern. But what makes matters worse is that the addictive nature of social media was designed with the intention of ensnaring user attention. In 2014, Facebook secretly conducted a study measuring their ability to influence users’ emotions via users’ Facebook feed, which they termed “emotional contagion”, by controlling the amount of positive and negative content that a user was shown. Besides the questionable ethics behind conducting the study in the first place, it’s clear that Facebook is aware of their power to manipulate users and are willing to exercise it without remorse.\nThough social media may prove harmful to user’s mental and physical health, social media companies have much to gain in creating such an addictive product. The more time a person spends on a social media site, the more ads they will see, and the more data can be collected. And while collecting user data for targeted ads may seem innocuous enough, it can be used for more nefarious purposes, such as mass surveillance. Just look at China’s social credit system, which ranks citizens based on their behavior and may punish citizens with slow internet or flight bans.\n“Social media platforms live and die on user engagement and the sale of their users’ data. That’s their entire business,” Lilith Marinho Davis, a blogger, said.\nIn this era of near limitless information, attention is the resource that’s in short supply and seen high demand, not information or computing power. In one UN policy brief, the attention economy was estimated to be worth US $7.1 trillion and 437 billion hours in 2016. Social media companies are able to commoditize attention by attracting users to their platform, which is often free to use and distribute content on.\nThere is a common internet adage which says, “If something is free, you’re the product” and nowhere is this more true than on social media sites and suddenly their tactics to retain user attention at whatever costs start to make more sense.\nSo user attention is a valuable commodity that is often sold to advertising companies. But is this practice as detrimental as it seems? From a corporate perspective, advertising does wonders for their bottom line and is virtually a staple of any economy based on capitalism. Google suggests that for every dollar companies invest in Google Ads, they generate an average revenue of two dollars. But it’s important to remember that corporations differ from individuals, corporations’ primary objective is not to foster community or enhance people’s lives. Instead, their focus is on increasing shareholder value, often achieved by boosting profits over time. From this standpoint, advertising is a powerful tool. It not only generates profits but spreads brand awareness and influences consumer decisions. On a broader scale, advertising has significant economic benefits. It stimulates consumption, contributing to economic growth, fosters competition and innovation and facilitates economies of scale.\nAdvertising can benefit users too, no matter how much people may loathe their presence; Advertising revenue is what supports content creation, the very thing that draws people to the internet. Without it, much of the content on the internet could not exist or may be of poorer quality. But the problem is the sheer quantity of bad advertising, ads that promote irrelevant products or are outright manipulative.\nIt has become so much of a problem that 200 million people worldwide are using ad block to solve it. The internet has seen not only an invasion of more ads, but also longer, inescapable ads (ie. 15 seconds-long, unskippable ads before, during, and after YouTube videos) that seriously detract from the online experience. It takes no stretch of the imagination to say that people hate ads ; they’re often irrelevant and interruptive, getting in the way of content people want to see. Increased advertisement expenditure has also been shown to be correlated with a decrease in a nation’s life satisfaction, which is rather intuitive since ads are designed to create desire and dissatisfaction, since happy and content people don’t tend to buy unnecessary items.   \nThe internet is what it is because advertisers and social media companies are driven towards profit and infinite growth, to the detriment of public health and general happiness. Profit is the language of capitalism and infinite growth its goal. Capitalism has perpetuated the idea that infinite growth is not only possible, but desirable, and that all companies that participate in the economy should strive to achieve infinite growth.\nEveryone alive in the year 2023, has only experienced consistent, global population growth; the S&P 500 has an average return of 7% year after year, and this mindset of infinite growth is so ingrained in the common psyche of the US that people base their retirement funds off an expectation of continuous stock market growth and interest rates. But the world has a finite amount of resources and production of any manufactured product has environmental costs (habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, and pollution), much of which go unaddressed. This single-minded dedication to growth and profit allows companies to disregard environmental impacts, the same way social media companies can set aside moral qualms about manipulating users, to the detriment of their mental and physical health.\nStrangely enough, social media is also a major way to connect people seeking to make change in the world and a tool to disseminate raw and unfiltered information. But social media algorithms aren’t optimized for disseminating truthful, unbiased journalism, they’re optimized to engage users and the content that does this the best is often highly “incendiary, controversial, or polarizing”, according to a UN policy report. In recent events, the war between Israel and Hamas has shocked and horrified the world, not only through videos of rockets being launched at Gaza, but the destruction happening on the ground, which people around the world can witness firsthand through the eyes of those whose homes are being destroyed and loved ones are harmed. This isn’t to say that these events are falsified or exaggerated but that part of the reason this issue has gone viral is because social media algorithms select for such provocative content. As more people rely on social media as their source of news%20or%20Reddit%20(8%25).), it can bias the information that people use to stay informed. The divide in American politics supporting or against Israel is not only a generational divide but also as a divide in how they receive information with younger people being more likely to use social media as a source of news.\nWhile older and younger generations may disagree on how the US should respond to the Israel-Hamas conflict, they can agree that the average citizen has too little power and lobbyists have too much. The arsenal that people do have at their disposal is their freedom of speech — their ability to protest and voice their opinions — but if major newspapers (NYT, The Atlantic) are all asking the same question, “Is There Any Point to Protesting?”, it doesn’t really matter what the answer is, does it? If this is the one tool people have to influence the world, then it should be better than something that maybe works or has stronger results than the “small, yet observable changes” one study states on how activism impacts public policy changes. While the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 attracted much attention to police brutality and racism in America, it had little to no impact on police funding. And more, the LA and NYC police department has actually increased funding since 2020. While every US citizen has the right to vote, it can be easy to feel that voting has little impact on politics which can be clearly seen in the 2016 election when Hilary Clinton won the popular vote but was not elected as president.\nDespite this, the average citizen is not entirely powerless. While presidential elections do get a great deal of press coverage, much of the politics citizens do have a say in is at the local level, and likewise, this is the type of government that people encounter the most. Local government may not be as flashy as the political battleground in Washington, but local government is what provides the services that can make a city pleasant to live in – from keeping streets free of potholes to ensuring that emergency services are there should residents need it. People are encouraged to vote on public decisions made by their community and at this level of government, your vote does feel like it matters.\nWhile social media can be addictive to the point of being a public health issue, the same factors that lend itself to addiction, can draw attention to problems in the world and gather support for change. Social media companies and all the underlying reasons for why they’re obsessed with user data and attention (advertising, capitalism, infinite growth) are not going to change anytime soon, so it is on the users to recognize this and be aware of that, not only for their own health but also to be informed of the powers who attempt to manipulate user behavior and vie for their attention. Staying informed in an age of constant change (much of it negative) can be difficult and draining, especially on platforms that fight to keep users scrolling (doom scrolling) but it is a civic responsibility. Despite feeling insignificant, especially in national politics, the average citizen is not powerless and continuing to exercise rights, like freedom of speech and voting, especially at local levels, can lead to progress."

Used to play Pokemon Tower Defense all the time as a kid (basically the same as Pokemon except you battle in a tower defense style match). For whatever reason, the online version no longer works (my guess is because Adobe Flash is no longer around / too many people are playing and the servers are overloaded) and I had to download the .swf file and an app to run the file. It’s actually incredible that this game (which I think is incredibly fun and full of things to do) is less than 10mb. So tempted to try reverse-engineering the game and take a look at the inner workings of the thing. I am very easily influenced by people / media and ever since I read “Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” I’ve wanted to make a game as a pet project. Too bad I’ve got midterms and presentations this week. :(\nIn other news, I am 100% convinced that an AI takeover will occur within the next 5 years (or perhaps decade). Open AI has released a new AI model, Sora, which can generate video from text. And not creepy, hallucinogenic videos either (think early, pre-Dall-E image generators) but fairly realistic videos that stick pretty closely to the given prompt too! I am terrified. And appropriately, news outlets started releasing videos on how to spot discrepancies in the videos to tell them apart from “real” videos filming the “real” world. This got me thinking, what is it that is inherently so special about the physical world that sets it apart from the imagined (human / machine generated). Sure these videos teaching you to spot the “fakes” focus on physical aspects, a spoon appearing / disappearing, impossible placements of limbs, historical inaccuracies, etc, but I feel like there has to be more than that.\nToday, I was hanging about the sheep barn, just looking at the (dead) vinyard and some enormous rabbits frolicking about, and I just thought to myself, “I could just look at this all day, if I didn’t have other obligations” and I’d never think that about a simple image / video (real or otherwise). There’s just something special about reality, being present in a space / time that I don’t think video / machine-imagined videos could recreate. Of course this doesn’t really solve / answer any problems / questions of created videos. But I think this presence is something that the best photographers strive for (and sometimes achieve) and might be what separates a real vs fake image."

This is the singular best news I have received all week, among other things, and feel compelled to share it here.\n\n\nTbh, the only reason I started a blog was because I can’t stop thinking about this Japanese blog I came across when I was looking for a very particular poem by William Gibson which I saw in a movie, A River’s Edge. (Don’t remember much about the movie except a vague sense of melancholy, almost like a more depraved version of Stand By Me?) Anyway, the movie ended with the poem, The Beloved being read aloud by the main characters. I love this poem and it’s just seems so strange to me that I can’t find anything at all about this poem on the internet. For a science fiction author who was so enthusiastic about the internet, it seems endlessly ironic that I’m unable to find anything on Gibson’s poems on the internet. (All except for Agrippa) which was meant to be read once and deleted as the poem was stored on a disc and “deleted” as the poem scrolls across the page!)\nAnyway, this was months ago, but I hunted down this art book which supposedly had the other two poems accompanying The Beloved. Can’t remember what the book was but for once I could not find an online copy and actually had to get the book shipped to the Davis library and borrow it then. Have never appreciated the true difficulty of finding information when the internet fails until now. My poor parents and their entire generation, actually learning from textbooks instead of Youtube and a random assortments of website. And just in case that very particular art books disappears from the face of the earth, I have attached the Gibson poems here."

Went hiking with friends and (I blame this on the invincibility of youth) but decided to run full-speed down this unexpectedly steep hill that went on for much longer than expected. At some point I tried to slow down, but could feel myself about to tumble if I tried so I just let gravity take me where it will. And I just fell head over heels into some bushes. Did not realize until later when I checked my phone that I was going (at max speed) 19 mi/hr. There was a very non-zero chance of breaking bones (including my neck) and I couldn’t really use my right arm for a day. I can just feel my common sense skill ringing in some xp points. Will not be trying this again.\nI’ve thought about this a lot but it’s so strange to me that humans as a species (and I suppose all animals) must learn the same lessons over and over again.

    "text": "The other day I watched a video on the evolution of halls and back when houses used to be one room, halls simply referred to the entirety of that room. But then we started subdividing our houses, adding living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, etc. and the meaning of the “hall” was shrunk down to only the remaining, unlabeled space.\nAnyway, I had the thought today that this feels a bit like the evolution of animal body plans. If you trace our evolutionary history far back enough, there was a point at which our ancestor was just a blob of cells, no differentiation, but then they start evolving into unique structures, and all that internal “space” (I guess it’s not space since I’m talking about cells) gets cut up and labelled (organs and tissues and cell types). Now that I think about it, hallways aren’t really analogous, since this seems to be the opposite. Evolution of body plans is more like the evolution of rooms. Silly me."

    "text": "As someone with absolutely zero artistic capabilities, I LOVE pressing flowers. It’s simple, easy, and I swear there is a science to it. If the need to make art is borne out of a desire to preserve some natural beauty in the world, then pressing flowers is the quintessential act of creating art since you’re not not simply creating a representation of the object as you would in say painting, but rather preserving the object itself.\nI suppose it could be argued that by pressing flowers, you can’t truly capture the beauty of flowers in the moment. Pressing / drying flowers almost always permanently alters the color (usually duller / less vibrant, whites inevitably darken to an unappealing brown), and hammers out any interesting shape (i can’t help but think of projections from linear algebra). (Ah I’d love to go on a tangent about how going in the opposite direction (from 2D to 3D) is at the crux of what makes electron microscopy (like Cryo-EM) so difficult). But with painting or any form of fine art really, 3D structure or the appearance of it anyway is somehow preserved (albeit from a single perspective only). It’s very much a trick, one of humanity’s finest imo, how we can take a 3D object / scene, recreate it on a 2D surface, yet still maintain the appearance that we’re looking at the original 3D view. But this takes skill, years of experience, a trained eye, and steady hands. Pressing flowers is a feat anyone could do to create an albeit imperfect image of nature.\nA happy medium then might be Gyotaku, the Japanese art of creating prints by dipping sealife in ink and pressing them to a page. You don’t preserve the object itself, in fact gyotaku was originally used by fisherman to record their catches, but the fish / whatever strange sea creature is used in the creation of the print.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom wikipedia\n\n\nIt was nothing more than a whim when I first started pressing flowers in high school. But I do remember writing about it in my college essays.\nNow though, I can’t walk around a city, park, or any sort of outdoor venue without looking at the flora. Even after 4 years at UC Davis, I still don’t remember some of the names of buildings but I do the location of every pomegranate tree within a mile radius of the school. In my head, plants and natural landmarks are what people are built to remember. Yes, language is a uniquely human trait but it’s also perhaps one of the most recent developments in the evolution of the brain. It exists almost entirely in our heads (words have no meaning unless they’re interpreted by some thinking creature), and so have less visual and spatial cues to trigger the memory of whatever meaning the word holds. We live in a physical world rich with sensory information: sights, sounds, smells; These are the things that we’ve been interested in for millennia and it’s just natural to think about the world in the form that we experience it instead of abstractions (words) that we invent.\nAnd I suppose there are some parallels that can be drawn between spatial & visual memory vs factual memory and flower pressing vs fine art. Spatial memory and flower pressing deals with objects directly (memorizing the trees / buildings instead of names or pressing flowers rather than drawing them) and factual memory and fine art deal with the objects indirectly (referring to a building by name or painting a flower). Just a thought.\nI took a class on flowers and the thing that stuck with me the most (besides the simple joy of being able to name random flowers) was that a product (flowers) which serves no other purpose besides looking pretty then slowly wilting (so a temporary object of beauty) could be a multi-billion dollar industry and is so deeply integrated into society. Like I can’t imagine Mother’s day without chrysanthemums and azaleas or Christmas without poinsettias. I’ve always imagined civilization to be a machine optimized for efficiency (or a captalistic society anyway). The market is such a ruthless battle for survival, businesses that are inefficient or produce substandard products are bound to die off. But flower industries? They’re thriving! despite the fact that they produce a good that’s neither necessary for survival nor do they make our lives easier.\nIronically, I used to think that buying flowers was such a waste of money (they’ll inevitably wilt and die, you can’t eat them or do anything practical with them, as you can with single use plastic). I say ironically, because I am obsessed with flowers when they’re still attached to the plant. But I think pressing flowers makes you intimately acquainted with their fleetingness, it’s a rush to get home before the petals wilt or start to brown. To me, this obsession with function is a bit of a cultural phenomenon. In my household, we never bought bouquets when I was growing up, though we did splurge once when we went to a neighbors’ place for Thanksgiving, which thinking back on it, the flowers did serve the purpose of being a gift, so not as frivolous as I thought.\nAsian culture is a bit too obsessed with stark functionality and getting ahead (both in career and social circles, imo. But I live in California not Asia, so it’s not really a problem I have to deal with and can go on picking flowers and getting mediocre grades without having a quarter life crisis.\nFinal thought. I feel like there’s something to be said about pursuit of beauty and its relationship to pursuit of knowledge. Reading a well-written, interesting paper (my favorite paper) lights up the same part of my brain that reading literary masterpieces (ie The Goldfinch or Ender’s Game) does. What this means (for me anyway) is that pursuit of knowledge is about generating interesting ideas (which are marvels in their own right, just as a artistic masterpieces are) or that revealing some new tidbit about the world is somewhat akin to how art pieces reveal a meaning that the artist is trying to portray. Both are about discovery. And what could be more beautiful than discovering nature.\nFinished undergrad with this gorgeous bouquet which I suppose is classic and very standard, but for me I feel like it’s very fitting. I’ve summed up the past couple with some flowers I have been compulsively picking and drying.\n\n\n\nThe bouquet in question\n\n\n\n\n\nMy flower collection from high school"

Not to say that some subjects are more useful than others (I don’t subscribe to the STEM superiority nonsense). And for some reason, it bothers me to think that given the freedom to do whatever I’d like, I’d still choose to study. And frankly, I’m ~75% confident that half the things I read will be forgotten by the next day. It seems like a bit of a useless task (albeit one I choose to do of my own free will) but it’s very much like pouring water into a leaky bucket. So why bother?\nI’ve given a lot of thought to this, but I honestly can’t put into words why I enjoy the things I do. I’ve met maybe one or two people in my life who have had interest in as broad a spectrum as I do and care to talk about any of it (right now it’s hacktivism, cybersecurity, game dev. and ofc!

Most recently, I read The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood by James Gleick and this may not be the greatest example since it’s a little more abstract than the hard sciences, but in the book, Gleick talks about communication and information. He starts out with African drums and how they can be used to communicate over incredibly large distances (but have only two symbols: high and low beats), moves on to telegraphs, then phones and along the way, he’s talking about Shannon and his information theory (creating a way of measuring the amount of information in a message or “bits”), Turing and his computer, Kolomogrov and complexity (how complex an object is can be measured by how long the shortest algorithm needed to generate is (ie 11111 is less complex than 133245), and so on. (It took me a year to read this book because I left it at home ~300 miles away, so I don’t remember details)\n(add years to things) But I was thinking, science is often taught in the order that it was discovered. Which makes intuitive sense, as I feel like scientific progress can be thought of as one giant mind (society) making consecutive discoveries (through its little minion scientists). While I’d love to put a genetics example, I think physics just makes more sense here. Normally (not at UC Davis where they love to put an incredibly un-intuitive spin on the curriculum) you’d start the series with gravity and forces (Newton, Hookes law) (things you’ve learned informally as a toddler (hopefully)), move on to atoms and particles (double slit experiment, Bohr’s model, Pauli, Rutherford, Leonard Jones), then electromagnetism and quantum (Faraday, Tesla, Edison). If you are even somewhat familiar with physics some of the names should be familiar. But what I’m trying to say is, the order in which these subjects lines up with roughly with the order that these discoveries happened. And based on how much the physics curriculum is hated at Davis, I feel like order of discovery is maybe the best order for learning.\nWhen I took history in HS, I remember it blew my mind to think that the Byzantine Empire existed during the time of the Inca Empire and that this took place thousands of years after the Egyptians. Because in history, they like to teach things by region (or at least they did in my classes) and I feel like this makes sense, there are so many things going on all the time, there’s simply no easy way to keep track of it all, all at once. Much simpler to simply break the world into bite size pieces and take it in one at a time. But the history of the Incas and the history of the Byzantines are essentially unrelated and the fact that they existed at the same time is inconsequential because the two empires never interacted due to geographical differences. In the physics example above however, people who were discovering things at the same time often worked together (Bohr, Pauli, and someone else?) would share ideas and influence each other, which must be reflected in their discoveries. So it may help students to learn things sequentially and perhaps connect the dots (in a way) for themselves.\nAnd then there’s CS. I think this differs from the other topics (not just STEM) in that it is wholly man made (only other exception is philosophy? and math?) and for the most apart, its development is not influenced by the world around it. By that I simply mean, CS principles are not explaining real world phenomena; algorithms developed are used to solve problems or just ingenious little puzzles we set for ourselves (we are clever little monkeys after all). Traversing a tree (DFS or BFS) or finding the shortest path between two vertices (Dijkstra’s algorithm) doesn’t have any basis in the real world, there is no fundamental truth of the world that these algorithms reveal. (I watched a video on Dijkstra’s and it reminds me of slime molds for some reason so I might be wrong on that) But because CS feels so removed from reality, I think the order for which CS is taught is even more tightly bound to the order in which concepts were invented. There was nothing for the innovators in the field to go on but methods and ideas that others had invented. So I feel like innovation in CS follows a very logical progression, just people making the next logical jump using what they had. Or is it logical?\nI “read” the Attention is all you need paper the other day (I say “read” because I understood individual words but not sentences (yes I can speak English, but at elementary levels apparently)) and I just thought to myself, “This is so complicated. How in the world did someone (or even a group of someones) come up with something as clever as this?” (I have some thoughts on individual vs group intelligence that I might expand on in another post) Is self-attention really the next logical progression after RNNs (some sort of neural network that I known next to nothing about but was the most prominent deep learning at the time. I think?) With algorithms like Dijkstra’s, you simply start from one node in a vertex, check its un-visited neighboring nodes, and check the distances from all those nodes to their neighboring nodes to find the shortest path. (makes more sense if you see it in action, link here), but this is fairly intuitive and I feel like the most obvious answer to the shortest path problem. But neural networks and transformers? When I first saw a neural network, I thought it was a spin-off of Markov Models, but I don’t think the two are ever really taught together (not that I’ve ever taken a machine learning class so what do I know). I feel like with science now, we’ve moved on from the “easy” stuff (not that it was ever easy, gosh I feel like Dennett with his arm chair philosophy and easy and hard problems of consciousness) but rather the logical, “next step” discoveries in science and we’ve moved past the questions that have plagued us for centuries (what are the fundamental building blocks of life (the cell / DNA) or nature (atoms)? How do they function) and now in addition to discovery, we have to start coming up with questions that we want answered OR these questions just pop up along the way. But in any case, these are questions that may never have been asked before in history (or maybe they have and I’m just yapping which is most likely the case)\n(I know I added the Lorenz attractor which has nothing at all to do with anything I talked about, but Gleick also wrote this book, Chaos: Making a New Science), which was the first book of his that I read. And I LOVED it. Also it’s just a very pleasant picture to look at. Better than any other visualization that could come out of information theory imo)"

    "text": "I recently finished a book (Bell Labs) (half the posts are essentially going to be thoughts I’ve had after finishing some book I’m afraid) which was about (you guessed it!) Bell Labs. One of the comments by a former employee about this institution was that we could never have anything quite like it. There was this unique mix of great management, great people (the great and famous ones: Shannon! Baker, Shockley, Kelly, on and on and on (apparently Nyquist worked there as well! thought he was mentioned only in passing, (well known in the world of signals?? I think, need to fact check))), a unique organization which allowed and encourage people to freely mingle and ideas to form as a result, freedom to pursue interesting projects (including in basic science which I believe is unheard of in industry research), and a derth of problems to solve (telecommunications is an insanely complicated field).\nBut my thought was, what about the people then made them unique thinkers and problem solvers. Of course, genius and passion are part of the equation but the start of the Young Turks (the most famous Bell Labs giants: …) career at Bell Labs began in the 50s. So these were people who had grown up in maybe the 30s and 40s, peak Depression era I would assume.\nI think there’s just something about growing up in the pre-mobile-phone era that made people a little more resourceful and a little more introspective which translates into being great physicists and engineers, wonderful at thinking up ideas and bringing them to life. There was something a professor said to me once, that younger generations look outwardly (by googling / asking) when they have a question while older generations look inward (thinking about the question) and I think that sums it up (to an extent!). I think the other problem is that everything we see has become so standardized (think of the lack of variety we see in products, the branding) and freely available (there’s really no need to build our own furniture)\nI’m just thinking of how people used to build their own radios, how (what’s his name) would build little, single person glider planes out on the California coast, how the o.g. hackers at MIT (the TMRC T… Model Railroad Club) built an incredibly intricate model railroads with a huge mess of mechanical relays and … (insert image). This is not to say that people don’t build things anymore (used to watch this guy (fighting robots guy, worked at Tesla)) but I feel like it’s so easy to find 3d printing templates or origami designs"

    "text": "As an avid reader of Wired (greatest magazine ever created as far as I’m concerned, though their invention of the banner ad mars their reputation), I think about the internet a lot. I’m a bit dismayed to report it’s where I spend a good portion of my day, either studying, consuming social media, or running digital errands, checking email and such, performing all the little tasks that have become necessary to keep my life running. But the disappointing bit is that, despite all the time I spend surfing the web, I’m not producing anything and any gains made are solely for my own benefit.\nRecently, I’ve had the pleasure of reading Virginia Heffernan’s &lt;3 book, Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art. Started it months ago, and finally finished today. I’ve always had a voracious appetite for reading, whether that’s through a screen or on paper, but with the internet, oh boy, it’s a never ending buffet of videos and audio and good old-fashioned text.\nYet, most people’s presence isn’t visible on the internet in any capacity as anything but a statistic on site analytics. The 90-10-1 Rule states that 90% of people are lurkers, 10% comment, like, post, etc. , and only 1% consistently produce original content. But is this truly such a bad thing? I think not. Unlike books, which I think could be considered an archaic version of the internet (you read things other people have written), you have the ability to comment on the web. I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit that I read a bit of Wattpad growing up. And one thing I did notice was the sense of community and support for the author there was in the comments section. Reading is often seen as a solitary activity, only in select situations (book clubs / bed time stories) are they communal, but the internet has made it so that all reading is a group activity, if that’s what you want. Everyone’s free to ignore the comments section, but when a post / video actually peaks my interest, I’ll often peak into the comments section. There you can speak about your own ideas or listen to others give their perspective. But the point is, with the internet, gives you the option to think more deeply, converse, pick apart, and even to contact the creators. With that being said, I don’t think lurking is necessarily a problem, it’s the default for reading, and only with the advent of the internet does lurking become a choice.\nAs a lifelong lurker, I feel like I’ve become a bit too shy to engage in Reddit discourse or god forbid the Youtube comments warzone. And I suppose the reason I made this blog was to create a space on the internet where I have total control. So much of our lives is spent in this virtual space, yet never have I been anything but a casual browser or contributing to a forum. But I feel that all of this is by design to some extent. Infinite scroll keeps you on the site and engaged with the material. Beyond that it doesn’t really matter what you do really. So much of the internet has been optimized to keep people on it for as long as possible, of course, I spend so much on time on social media that it seems like this is all there is at times. It’s two things really that makes the entire gimmick of social media so addictive, the ease with which you can see new content (a swipe is all you need) and the algorithm. That mythical force capable of trawling through the infinite void of content and finding the perfect dose of dopamine packaged in a neat little 30 second video. On one hand, yes the algorithm is an engineering marvel but on the other hand, it’s effectiveness is also a result of the way the internet is organized. The most important feature of the world wide web is hypertext, that innocuous blue text which allows pages and sites to be linked together. Without it, the network falls apart into a sea of unconnected nodes, each inaccessible from any other.\nWebsites and apps are, in my mind, not connected in a typical spatial manner. On my own device, I have files organized under folders and to find anything, I have to dig in a top down approach. But on the internet, sites are linked by tags and not necessarily by topic (i.e. cooking being labelled along with woodwork due to the need for recipes / manuals for both). What this mean is that there are no landmarks to guide a user from one site to another.\nRecalling where you’ve been after spending a few hours browsing Youtube is incredibly difficult (for me anyway), especially if it’s in the Shorts format. The volume of information people consume is incredible and simply overwhelming. For whatever reason, information found on social media often doesn’t give the same sense of satisfaction as reading or even watching tv or playing video games. There is neither a narrative (like books / movies) nor user involvement (video games). Because of the lack of need for either background knowledge or knowledge of game dynamics, they are easy to jump into, and especially for short videos, it’s so very easy to continue watching once started. But more than any other emotion, I feel guilt and an uneasy sense that I am simply wasting time when watching shorts / scrolling through Instagram. My refusal to use TikTok is mainly because of the fact that an entire platform made of short-form videos (arguably the most addictive type of content sans p***) is horrifying to me. It is a black hole that I don’t think I have the willpower to climb out of if I ever get started.\nI wouldn’t go so far as to say that I disdain TikTok creators, some videos that I have seen could most definitely classify as art but my impression of the vast majority of TikTok videos is that they’re shallow and base, either unabashedly manipulative (I’m thinking of those “Do you have ADHD?” videos) or appeal to the desperate, lonely aspects of human nature (random videos of human interactions). But that’s my opinion and I know I am being unnecessarily harsh, maybe because I can’t accept the fact that I watch TikTok videos too, albeit through Youtube shorts or Instagram reels.\nBut the sense that I’m wasting time is mostly brought on by the fact that 1. there’s nothing I leave behind when watching a video or scrolling through posts and 2. content is either so short or trivial or both that I retain no memory of what I’ve just seen. Isn’t that the essence of frittering your life away? No mark left behind and no mark is left on you. What happened in that hour you spent scrolling through Instagram? If so much of our life is spent this way, haven’t we essentially been robbed of our lifespan? I’m honestly terrified of what life will be like in 20 years. Will I even have anything to remember by the end of it? That’s an awfully depressing thought. No wonder everyone in this generation is depressed."
