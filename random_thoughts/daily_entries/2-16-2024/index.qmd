I've been listening to Les Mis everyday for at least the past two weeks. Can't report any change in mood besides being a bit more anxious and tired. I think my resting bpm is at least 5 beats higher than normal. It kills me that my favorite character is Eponine, who deserved so much more. Considering the environment (living with heartless, money grubbing parents) she grew up in, I think she turned out v. well. And she falls in love with this nice chap, Marius, and they're the best of friends and she takes a bullet for him, but he doesn't even love her back?! And a mere five songs after her death throes, after all his friends have also died, Marius is marrying Colette. What a cruel world.
