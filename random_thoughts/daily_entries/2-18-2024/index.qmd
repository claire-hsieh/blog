Have just done the nerdiest thing ever and made a little batch script (still don't know how to write shell scripts, had much help from github copilot) to automate my calibre workflow to convert books to epub and clean them up a bit in the process. In other news, The Backseat Lovers is making a bid for the title of "my favorite band". Have been listening to them non-stop since this morning. Love that the lead singer will just randomly scream, despite being such a sweet, soft-spoken normally. Love even more that they're just some guys from Utah. Seems like an exotic place to me, for whatever reason. V in the middle of nowhere, small town vibes. Though to me, Davis (pop \~66,000) is small so take that how you will.
