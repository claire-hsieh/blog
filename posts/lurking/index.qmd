As an avid reader of Wired (greatest magazine ever created as far as I'm concerned, though their invention of the banner ad mars their reputation), I think about the internet *a lot*. I'm a bit dismayed to report it's where I spend a good portion of my day, either studying, consuming social media, or running digital errands, checking email and such, performing all the little tasks that have become necessary to keep my life running. But the disappointing bit is that, despite all the time I spend surfing the web, I'm not producing anything and any gains made are solely for my own benefit.

Recently, I've had the pleasure of reading Virginia Heffernan's \<3 book, *Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art*. Started it months ago, and finally finished today. I've always had a voracious appetite for reading, whether that's through a screen or on paper, but with the internet, oh boy, it's a never ending buffet of videos and audio and good old-fashioned text.

Yet, most people's presence isn't visible on the internet in any capacity as anything but a statistic on site analytics. The [90-10-1 Rule](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-you-know-whos-lurking-90-social-media-users-lurkers-joey-little/) states that 90% of people are lurkers, 10% comment, like, post, etc. , and only 1% consistently produce original content. But is this truly such a bad thing? I think not. Unlike books, which I think could be considered an archaic version of the internet (you read things other people have written), you have the *ability* to comment on the web. I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I read a bit of Wattpad growing up. And one thing I did notice was the sense of community and support for the author there was in the comments section. Reading is often seen as a solitary activity, only in select situations (book clubs / bed time stories) are they communal, but the internet has made it so that *all* reading is a group activity, if that's what you want. Everyone's free to ignore the comments section, but when a post / video actually peaks my interest, I'll often peak into the comments section. There you can speak about your own ideas or listen to others give their perspective. But the point is, with the internet, gives you the option to think more deeply, converse, pick apart, and even to contact the creators. With that being said, I don't think lurking is necessarily a problem, it's the default for reading, and only with the advent of the internet does lurking become a choice.

As a lifelong lurker, I feel like I've become a bit too shy to engage in Reddit discourse or god forbid the Youtube comments warzone. And I suppose the reason I made this blog was to create a space on the internet where I have total control. So much of our lives is spent in this virtual space, yet never have I been anything but a casual browser or contributing to a forum. But I feel that all of this is by design to some extent. Infinite scroll keeps you on the site and engaged with the material. Beyond that it doesn't really matter what you do really. So much of the internet has been optimized to keep people on it for as long as possible, of course, I spend so much on time on social media that it seems like this is all there is at times. It's two things really that makes the entire gimmick of social media so addictive, the ease with which you can see new content (a swipe is all you need) and the algorithm. That mythical force capable of trawling through the infinite void of content and finding the perfect dose of dopamine packaged in a neat little 30 second video. On one hand, yes the algorithm is an engineering marvel but on the other hand, it's effectiveness is also a result of the way the internet is organized. The most important feature of the world wide web is hypertext, that innocuous blue text which allows pages and sites to be linked together. Without it, the network falls apart into a sea of unconnected nodes, each inaccessible from any other.

Websites and apps are, in my mind, not connected in a typical spatial manner. On my own device, I have files organized under folders and to find anything, I have to dig in a top down approach. But on the internet, sites are linked by tags and not necessarily by topic (i.e. cooking being labelled along with woodwork due to the need for recipes / manuals for both). What this mean is that there are no landmarks to guide a user from one site to another.

Recalling where you've been after spending a few hours browsing Youtube is incredibly difficult (for me anyway), especially if it's in the Shorts format. The volume of information people consume is incredible and simply overwhelming. For whatever reason, information found on social media often doesn't give the same sense of satisfaction as reading or even watching tv or playing video games. There is neither a narrative (like books / movies) nor user involvement (video games). Because of the lack of need for either background knowledge or knowledge of game dynamics, they are easy to jump into, and especially for short videos, it's *so* very easy to continue watching once started. But more than any other emotion, I feel guilt and an uneasy sense that I am simply wasting time when watching shorts / scrolling through Instagram. My refusal to use TikTok is mainly because of the fact that an entire platform made of short-form videos (arguably the most addictive type of content sans p\*\*\*) is horrifying to me. It is a black hole that I don't think I have the willpower to climb out of if I ever get started.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that I disdain TikTok creators, some videos that I have seen could most definitely classify as art but my impression of the vast majority of TikTok videos is that they're shallow and base, either unabashedly manipulative (I'm thinking of those "Do you have ADHD?" videos) or appeal to the desperate, lonely aspects of human nature (random videos of human interactions). But that's my opinion and I know I am being unnecessarily harsh, maybe because I can't accept the fact that I watch TikTok videos too, albeit through Youtube shorts or Instagram reels.

But the sense that I'm wasting time is mostly brought on by the fact that 1. there's nothing I leave behind when watching a video or scrolling through posts and 2. content is either so short or trivial or both that I retain no memory of what I've just seen. Isn't that the essence of frittering your life away? No mark left behind and no mark is left on you. What happened in that hour you spent scrolling through Instagram? If so much of our life is spent this way, haven't we essentially been robbed of our lifespan? I'm honestly terrified of what life will be like in 20 years. Will I even have anything to remember by the end of it? That's an awfully depressing thought. No wonder everyone in this generation is depressed.
